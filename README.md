A growing collection of Python-based audio utilities for loading, analysing, normalising, scanning, and batch‑processing sound files.

Designed for audio engineers, music producers, sound designers, game developers, and dataset creators.

The project follows a clear separation of concerns:
- **Core backend engine** (shared logic)
- **Read‑only analysis tools**
- **Explicit, safe rendering tools**

FFmpeg is treated as the **reference loudness engine** where loudness measurement is involved.

---

## 🚀 Overview

BlueByte Audio Tools provides lightweight, robust, and reliable audio-processing scripts powered by:

- **librosa**  
- **numpy**  
- **soundfile**  
- **matplotlib**

Every script includes input validation, error handling, clean terminal output, and safe‑file operations.

As of the current development stage, all tools share a common backend engine (`bb_audio.py`) that centralizes audio loading, validation, normalization logic, file handling, and safety checks. This ensures consistency, easier maintenance, and future readiness for CLI and GUI interfaces.

## ✅ Code Quality & Testing

All core backend logic is fully unit-tested using **pytest**.

- Deterministic functions are covered with pure unit tests
- File-system behavior is tested using temporary directories
- Audio I/O is tested via mocking (no real decoding required)
- Safety logic (dry-run, overwrite protection, skip rules) is explicitly verified
- FFmpeg stderr parsing is validated via unit tests (including multiline true-peak blocks)

An end-to-end **integration sanity check** has also been performed using real audio files to confirm correct behavior of the full processing pipeline.

This ensures the project is safe to refactor, extend, and maintain over time.

---

## 📦 Tools Overview

BlueByte Audio Tools is intentionally modular. Each script does one job well and relies on a shared backend (`bb_audio.py`) to ensure consistent behavior across the entire toolchain.

---

## 🔹 `bb_audio.py` (Core Backend Engine)
A reusable internal module that powers all BlueByte Audio Tools.

### **Responsibilities**
- Defines supported audio formats in one place  
- Scans folders and returns valid audio file paths  
- Loads audio safely while preserving sample rate  
- Performs peak normalization with safety checks  
- Handles audio file writing with robust error reporting  
- Centralizes write-decision logic (skip / overwrite / dry-run) via `should_write_file()`
- Provides reusable peak utilities (`peak_value()` and `peak_normalise()`) used across tools
- Provides a single safe-save path via `save_audio()` (consistent error handling and messages)
- Keeps file discovery consistent across tools via `list_audio_files()` (same extension rules everywhere)
- Reduces duplication across CLI tools (batch normalise, LUFS analysis, future tools)

All user‑facing tools import this module to avoid duplicated logic and inconsistent behavior.

### **Public API (Functions)**
The backend exposes a small, stable function surface:

- `list_audio_files(folder)` → returns supported audio file paths
- `load_audio_mono(path)` → loads audio as mono while preserving sample rate
- `peak_value(audio)` → returns sample peak (linear)
- `peak_normalise(audio, target_peak)` → returns normalised audio + safety checks
- `save_audio(path, audio, sr)` → writes audio to disk safely
- `should_write_file(path, overwrite, dry_run)` → returns `(ok_to_write, reason)` where reason is one of: `new`, `overwrite`, `skip`, `dry_run`

This module is not intended to be run directly.  
It exists to keep tool behavior consistent (same file rules, same safety rules, same error handling).
All user-facing scripts import and rely on this shared engine.

## 🔹 `load_audio.py`
A waveform viewer and audio inspection tool.

### **Features**
- Validates file existence  
- Checks extension (`.wav`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.aiff`, `.aif`)  
- Loads audio with error handling  
- Displays:
  - File name  
  - Sample rate  
  - Duration  
  - Number of samples  
- Renders waveform via matplotlib  

### **Usage**
```bash
python3 load_audio.py
```

---

## 🔹 `normalise_single.py`
A safe single‑file peak‑normalization utility.

### **Features**
- Validates file and extension  
- Loads audio safely  
- Computes original peak amplitude  
- Normalizes to 90% of full‑scale (~ −1 dBFS headroom)  
- Outputs a cleanly prefixed file  
- Prints a detailed processing summary  

### **Usage**
```bash
python3 normalise_single.py
```

---

## 🔹 `folder_scanner.py`
A file‑system helper that identifies all supported audio files in a folder.

### **Features**
- Reads directory contents  
- Filters valid audio formats (`.wav`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.aiff`, `.aif`)  
- Skips folders and unsupported entries  
- Prints a neatly ordered, numbered file list  
- Provides the foundation for all batch operations  

### **Usage**
```bash
python3 folder_scanner.py
```
Scans the current directory by default.  
Modify `target_folder = "."` inside the script to scan other locations.

---

## 🔹 `batch_normalise.py`
A batch peak‑normalisation processor for multiple audio files.

### **Features**
- Scans a directory for valid audio files  
- Loads each file safely with error handling  
- Skips silent files  
- Normalizes all files to 90% of full‑scale (~ −1 dBFS)  
- Saves new files using a safe `normalized_` prefix  
- Outputs per‑file results and a final batch report  
- Configurable target peak via CLI (`--target_peak`)
- Optional output folder to keep original files untouched (`--output_folder`)
- Automatically skips already-normalized files
- Safe repeated runs without recursive normalization
- Dry-run mode to preview processing without writing any files (`--dry_run`)
- Supports optional WAV and FLAC output format conversion via CLI (`--format`)
- Explicit dry-run messaging that explains skips, overwrites, and writes
- End-of-run batch summary with processed, skipped, and written counts
- Fully covered by unit tests with verified real-world integration behavior

### **Usage**
```bash
# Normalize all supported audio files in the current directory
python3 batch_normalise.py

# Set a custom target peak
python3 batch_normalise.py --target_peak 0.8

# Normalize files from a specific folder
python3 batch_normalise.py --folder ./audio

# Save normalized files to a separate output folder
python3 batch_normalise.py --output_folder normalized_out

# Preview what would be processed without saving files
python3 batch_normalise.py --dry_run

# Convert normalized output to FLAC
python3 batch_normalise.py --format flac

# Preview batch behavior without writing files
python3 batch_normalise.py --dry_run --output_folder normalized_out
```

### **Behavior Notes**
- Files starting with `normalized_` are skipped automatically to prevent recursive processing.
- Output files are prefixed with `normalized_` to avoid overwriting originals.
- Dry-run mode performs all checks and calculations but never creates folders or writes files.
- Dry-run mode reports what *would* happen, including skips and overwrites, without writing files.
- Batch summary statistics are printed at the end of every run.

## 🔹 `lufs_analyse.py`
A professional loudness analysis utility supporting both Python-based and FFmpeg-based measurement engines.

### **Features**
- Integrated LUFS measurement (ITU-R BS.1770 compliant)
- Optional engine selection:
  - Python engine (`pyloudnorm`) for fast, dependency-light analysis
  - FFmpeg engine for industry-standard reference measurements
- Optional comparison mode (`--compare`) to validate Python results against FFmpeg
- Reports:
  - Integrated LUFS
  - Momentary max loudness
  - Short-term max loudness
  - Loudness Range (LRA)
  - Sample peak (dBFS)
  - True Peak (dBTP, FFmpeg engine)
- Graceful handling of silence and very short audio
- Fully unit-tested FFmpeg parsing logic
- Target LUFS compliance reporting (`--target_lufs`, `--tolerance`)
- Optional gain application to create a loudness-targeted file (`--apply`)
- Safety default: **no file is written** when already within tolerance; use `--force_apply` to write anyway
- Dry-run support for apply mode (`--dry_run`) to preview the write without creating output
- Custom output path for apply mode (`--output`)
- Target reference selection in compare mode (uses **FFmpeg integrated** as the reference)

### **Usage**
```bash
# Analyze a file using the Python engine
python3 lufs_analyse.py audio.wav

# Use FFmpeg as the loudness engine
python3 lufs_analyse.py audio.wav --engine ffmpeg

# Compare Python and FFmpeg results
python3 lufs_analyse.py audio.wav --compare

# Check a file against a target loudness (compliance report)
python3 lufs_analyse.py audio.wav --target_lufs -14

# Apply the suggested gain and write a new file (skips writing if already compliant)
python3 lufs_analyse.py audio.wav --target_lufs -14 --apply

# Force writing even if the file is already within tolerance
python3 lufs_analyse.py audio.wav --target_lufs -14 --apply --force_apply
